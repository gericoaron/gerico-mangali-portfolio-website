# gerico-mangali-portfolio-website
my simple personal portfolio website, for more description check html comments!

                                               <!-- READ ME -->

<!-- The ui/ux design is inspired to the youtuber bedimcode with his video "mini portfolio website". this project is 
created for personal portfolio purposes, as you explore the codes, the approach is very different to what he used in the 
video, because as I mentioned I only use the video for getting inspirations because I like the minimalist and 
aesthetic theme of the design -->
